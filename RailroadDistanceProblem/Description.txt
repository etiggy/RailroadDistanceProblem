There is a rail road to different towns from one town. It is considered that the rail road is one way because of budgetary issues. 
If there is city A and it has cities B and C connected by rail roads, it is not mandatory that A has direct railroad to both B and C. 
The route to C from A can be A to B and then B to C. 

The above scenario is depicted as a graph. The nodes are the towns and edges are the distances between them. The input given will be a graph 
and also the route to towns. The output must be the total rail road distance between the towns and if no route exists, it must say 'No Route exists'.

NODE 1      NODE 2      DISTANCE
   A                 B                  5
   B                 C                  2
   C                 D                  3
   B                 E                  4




Input 1:
A-B-E

Input 2:
A-C-E

Output 1:
9

Output 2:
No Route Exists
